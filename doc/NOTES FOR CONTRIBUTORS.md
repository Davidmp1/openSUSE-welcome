# Contributor Notes

## Building
Between builds, be sure to remove the i18n.qrc file.

## Desktop Files
The desktop file in the root of the repository is what should be copied to /usr/share/applications/ and /etc/xdg/autostart.
The desktop file in desktop-file is what gets copied to ~/.config/autostart to disable starting on launch.
